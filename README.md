# facebooc

I bet a friend that a semi-competent dev. could write a basic
Facebook clone in C in a couple of days. To make things a bit more
interesting I decided not to use anything other than the standard GNU
C lib and SQLite3. This is the result.

# Building and running

This will not work on Windows and it's only been tested on OS X
Mavericks.

    git clone https://github.com/Bogdanp/facebooc.git
    cd facebooc
    make run


# Warning

This is just a fun exercise. You wouldn't want to use any of this code
in a production env.
